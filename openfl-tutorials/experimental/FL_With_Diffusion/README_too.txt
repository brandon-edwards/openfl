Not commited to the repo was a 'Results' folder in the same directory as this README_too. This was copied into /raid/edwardsb/projects/fl_with_diffusion/Results/. There was also a 'data' folder containing folders 'by_collaborator' and  'cifar-10-batches-py' as well as file 'cifar-10-python.tar.gz'. The by_collaborator folder is a cache folder and will be used if you run the code (prevents continually reconstructing by collaborator data with multiple runs). I think the tar.gz file gets pullled from online if it is not present. Whatever happens was the same workflow for the ML Privacy Meter tutorial.
